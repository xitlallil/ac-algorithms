/*
All non-prime numbers can be written as a multiplication of that number's prime divisors.
Sounds complicated but it is pretty simple.
Examples:
10 = 2 x 5 --> [2,5]
6 = 2 x 3 --> [2,3]
51 = 3 x 17 --> [3,17]
27 = 3 x 3 x 3 --> [3]
35 = 5 x 7 --> [5,7]
100 = 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 --> [2,5]
111111 = 3 x 7 x 11 x 13 x 37 --> [3,7,11,13,37]

Given a number n, write a function that returns a list of the prime divisors of that number.

Hint: You do not have to worry about finding numbers that are prime to divide the number,
as long as you start from 2 and keep dividing with 2 until you can't anymore before proceeding to 
3,4,5 ... If you divide with 2 as many as times as possible then you won't be able to divide with 4
so you do not need to worry about it.

Hint: If the input number is prime you should get the number as the solution. Your code should take
care of it.
