//Check for Palindromes
//Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.

//A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

//Note: You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything lower case in order to check for palindromes.

//We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as "racecar", "RaceCar", and "race CAR" among others.

//Here are some helpful links:

//String.replace() https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace
//String.toLowerCase() https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLowerCase

//TEST CASES

//palindrome("eye") should return true.
//palindrome("race car") should return true.
//palindrome("not a palindrome") should return false.
//palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal. Panama") should return true.
//palindrome("never odd or even") should return true.
//palindrome("nope") should return false.
//palindrome("almostomla") should return false.
//palindrome("My age is 0, 0 si ega ym.") should return true.
//palindrome("1 eye for of 1 eye.") should return false.
//palindrome("0_0 (: /-\ :) 0-0") should return true.
